        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A small glimpse of me: I will be turning 28 years old this year as I pursue my degree in 
        mathematics. I am currently a junior with the intention of going to gradtuate school.
        Academics have been an important aspect of my life since a number of surgeries I had as
        a teenager. Currently, I work as an ECaMS tutor here on campus. My family is fairly large 
        being the second youngest of five kids. I was born 
        in New York but grew up here in Illinois for the past 20 years.

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <p>I would really like to become comfortable/familiar with the syntax of a few programming 
        languages. Mathematics has been integrated with computer systems that I’ve felt the need
        to learn more about how to navigate and operate them more efficiently as I progress through
        my degree.

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
        <p>I enjoy reading epic fantasy (I reread almost 12 out of the 14 book series “Wheel of Time” 
        over the summer) and some non-fiction pieces sprinkled in. 
            <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/books-and-art" target="_blank">Brandon Sanderson</a>
        finished the Wheel of time series and writes wonderful 
            <a href="https://www.campfirewriting.com/codex/epic-fantasy" target="_blank">epic fantasy</a>. 
        I also enjoy maintaining an above average level of fitness as I’ve gotten older through multiple 
        modalities such as:
            <ul class="square-list">
                <li>running</li>
                <li>swimming</li>
                <li>yoga</li>
                <li>weight lifting</li>
            </ul>
                I am also an avid anime 
                watcher and miss when anime episodes were drawn by different artist like the episodes from 
                DragonBall Z.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I don’t have anything particular “fun” about myself outside of having an unusual background 
        and perspective. I’m licensed as a massage therapist in the state of Illinois and was a 
        teaching assistant for massage therapy at the age of 19.
